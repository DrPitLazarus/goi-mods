[BuffKit_SCS_521.0.0.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17405629/BuffKit_SCS_521.0.0.zip)
- **SimpleFixes**:
  - New **NoScrambleByDefault**: Scramble checkbox on Create Match screen is now unchecked by default.
  - New **FixClearNotifications**: The clear all notifications button now cleans up stuck notifications. Noticed certain territory notifications were not dismissible during the Gauntlet event. This does not fix the individual clear buttons, however.
  - **Scroll Sensitivity Adjustments**:
    - Chat window: `10 -> 30`.
    - Library pages except Lore: `20 -> 60`.
 - **SkirmishAlerts**: Add Spectator Only Setting, enabled by default. `skirmish alerts > spectator only`
 - **MatchRefTools**: 
   - New **ForceStartModButton**: Adds a Force Start button to the match lobby footer. There is a confirm prompt. Enabled by default. 
   Setting: `ref tools > force start mod button`

- **ShipLoadoutViewer**:
  - New **CrewFactionDisplay**: See everyone's faction without checking everyone's profile. Disabled by default.
  This calls `GetUserProfile` once for every player like you would normally. Factions are cached for the game session and do not get updated.
  Setting: `loadout viewer > crew loadout faction display`. `crew loadout viewer` must also be enabled.
  - New **CrewToolTooltips**: Like the gun tooltips, you can now hover/click crew tools to display tooltips for tools! That's a lot of tools!
  Setting: `loadout viewer > lobby crew tool tooltip display`. Options: `disabled`, `hover`, `click` (default).
