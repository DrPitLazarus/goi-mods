Currently, I have one mod for the game Guns of Icarus Online / Alliance.

- [SkipLauncherAndIntro](SkipLauncherAndIntro/readme.md) - [Downloads](https://github.com/DrPitLazarus/goi-mods/releases/tag/SkipLauncherAndIntro)

## Install BepInEx mod loader

Before any mods will work, you will need to install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx), a popular modding framework for Unity games.

_If you already have BepInEx in your game folder, skip to the next section._

1. Download the latest [BepInEx v5.zip](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.22/BepInEx_x86_5.4.22.0.zip).
2. Extract contents to your `Guns of Icarus Online` game folder. You should see the `BepInEx` folder in the same folder as `GunsOfIcarusOnline.exe`.
3. It is recommended to start the game once before adding any mods.

## Install mods

Simply drop the .dll into `Guns of Icarus Online/BepInEx/Plugins` folder. :D
